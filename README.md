- 👋 Hi, I’m @MovingMazes. This name is derived from the possibility to approch/redefine life as a way to interact with reality as if reality would be moving mazes. 
-      Of course this is not completely true, because the laws of physics do not move.
-      But we, humans, we live in time and there will not be 2 instants in our lives that will be exactly the same as far as I can see. 
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything. 
-      But if I write here it is to emphasize on the needed concept of "convergence".
-      ( which, IMHO, may help bringing back some harmony in the way people interact in the world. )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I've stopped learning except in mathematics, because 
-         1) I am old) 
-         2) I consider mathematics to be useful in almost every field of knowledge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on changing the world, which mean changing :
-         1) ourselves one by one
-         2) the surrounding infrastructure that we create for our lives
- 📫 How to reach me : write to movingmazes@yahoo.com, mentioning 
-         1) why you want to reach me and 
-         2) that you read this on github. 
-         Insist because I do not read all my mails, so you may need some many attemps to get noticed by myself.
